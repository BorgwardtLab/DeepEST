# DeepEST
This is the repository with the implementation of DeepEST, a multimodal method to perform protein function prediction for bacterial species. Given the characteristics of their genome, the functional characterization of bacteria cannot rely solely on protein sequences. In fact, it requires the use of data sources capable of capturing different dimensions of the protein functionality, i.e., protein structures and expression-location patterns.

The architecture of DeepEST is visualized in the following figure:
